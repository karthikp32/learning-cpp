General Notes:
1) Command to run c++ program is "g++ -g -o ch3 ch3.cpp"

Ch.3 Notes:
-There are 8 bits in 1 byte
-There are 2^n values for n bits
-Doubles are 8 bytes
-Floats are 4 bytes
-Ints are 4 bytes
-Chars are 1 byte
-Math with ints leads to truncated values
-5/2 = 2
-Decimal point will lead the compiler to interpret the operation as a floating-point operation
-5.0/2.0 = 2.5

Ch.4 Notes:
-An expression is a statement, or series of statements, that evaluates to a single value
-To the compiler, an expression is true if it evaluates to a nonzero number
-To the compiler, an expression is false if it evaluates to zero
-the bool type is a type that can hold two values, true and false
-The precedence order for Boolean operators and comparison operators is
  1)!
